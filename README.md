DISCRIPTION : My third task is Image Classification Model, where I trained a machine learning model to classify images into different categories. I implemented this using deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to extract features and improve classification accuracy. The model was trained and tested on a dataset using Google Colab, ensuring efficient execution and optimal performance. I also applied techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance the model's generalization. To maintain proper documentation and version control, I uploaded the code to GitHub, along with relevant outputs showcasing the modelâ€™s classification results. This task helped me understand image preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation in deep learning. Running the implementation in Google Colab allowed me to utilize cloud resources efficiently, and by storing everything on GitHub, I ensured easy access, collaboration, and tracking of modifications for future improvements and debugging.
